Welcome to our blog! This is the first post.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that allows you to write JSX in Markdown documents. You can import components, like the one below:

<CustomComponent />

## Code Example

```jsx
function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}
```

That's it for now!
