# Getting Started with React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. Here's a simple component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

## State and Props

State is managed within the component, while props are passed from parent components.

### Using State

Here's how to use state in React:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This is a great way to build interactive UIs!
