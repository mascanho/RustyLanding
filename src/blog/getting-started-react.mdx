# Getting Started with React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. Here's a simple component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

## State and Props

State is managed within the component, while props are passed from parent components.

This is a great way to build interactive UIs!
